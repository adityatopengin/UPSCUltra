Goldilocks zone is the area around a star where it is not too hot and not too cold for liquid water to exist on the surface of surrounding planets. The newest such planet was found by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission, which it launched in 2018. Very few such Earth-size planets have been found so far, including some by NASA's Kepler mission, and this one is the first such discovery by TESS. TOI 700 d measures 20% larger than Earth. It orbits its star once every 37 days and receives an amount of energy that is equivalent to 86% of the energy that the Sun provides to Earth. The star, TOI 700, is an 'M dwarf' located just over 100 light-years away in the southern constellation Dorado, is roughly 40% of our Sun's mass and size, and has about half its surface temperature.",

    "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: Sodium vapour lights are omnidirectional. Omnidirectional lights produce light in 360 degrees. This is a large system inefficiency because at least half of the light needs to be reflected and redirected to the desired area being illuminated. Whereas, whereas LEDs are extremely energy efficient relative to every other commercially available lighting technology. There are several reasons for this, including the fact they waste very little energy in the form of infrared radiation (much different than most conventional lights, including fluorescent lights), and they emit light directionally (over 180 degrees versus 360 degrees which means there are far fewer losses from the need to redirect or reflect light). The Low-Pressure Sodium lamp was the first sodium lamp to be developed. It is known for its signature monochromatic yellow colour. It is mostly used in Europe since it did not appeal in other markets due to its poor CRI or colour rendering. Statement 2 is not correct : The benefit of High-Pressure Sodium is that they are the only light source with similar efficiency to LEDs and maintain luminescence fairly well. They also do have great life spans - around 24,000 hours - though this is significantly less than LEDs. The benefits of using LEDs are extensive. The most significant benefits are extremely long lifespans (50,000 to 100,000 hours or more), very high energy efficiency, extremely high light quality and little to no maintenance costs.

(Statement 1 is correct) - y The real colour of the Sun is actually white. Dawn is the time that marks the beginning of twilight before sunrise.

Since energy and mass are equivalent, all forms of energy (including light) also cause gravitation and are under the influence of it. Objects with more mass have more gravity. Gravity also gets weaker with distance. So, the closer objects are to each other, the stronger their gravitational pull is. The gravitational force is weaker than the other four fundamental forces. Statement (b) is correct: The electromagnetic force is the force responsible for all electromagnetic processes. It acts between electrically charged particles. It is an infiniteranged force, much stronger than the gravitational force, and obeys the inverse square law, but neither electricity or magnetism adds up in the way that gravitational force does. Since there are positive and negative charges (poles), these charges tend to cancel each other out. Electromagnetism includes the electrostatic force acting between charged particles at rest, and the combined effect of electric and magnetic forces acting between charged particles moving relative to each other. Statement (c) is correct: There are three forms of radioactivity, alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha decay only occurs in heavier elements which give up energy when the nucleus is divided. Beta decay is where a neutron turns into a proton by emitting an electron or a proton turns into a neutron by emitting a positron. Gamma decay normally happens after alpha or beta decay when the nucleus is in an excited state. Beta radioactivity is the best-known manifestation of the weak force. It's a slow process as it occurs with difficulty. Unlike nuclear forces and electromagnetism, the weak force can transform a neutron into a proton or vice versa, thus changing the composition of a nucleus. Statement (d) is correct: The strong nuclear force, also called the strong nuclear interaction, is the strongest of the four fundamental forces of nature. It is six thousand trillion times stronger than the force of gravity and that is because it binds the fundamental particles of matter together to form larger particles. It holds together the quarks that makeup protons and neutrons, and part of the strong force also keeps the protons and neutrons of an atom's nucleus together.",

    "explanation": "Option (d) is correct: An artificial satellite moving around the Earth in a circular orbit possesses an acceleration which is 'constant' in magnitude but 'changing in direction'. An artificial satellite revolves around the earth under centripetal acceleration. Acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes with time, in terms of both speed and direction. An artificial satellite maintains its orbit by balancing two factors: its velocity, that is the speed it takes to travel in a straight line and the gravitational pull that Earth has on it. An artificial satellite orbiting closer to the Earth requires more velocity to resist the stronger gravitational pull.",

    "explanation": "Option (a) is correct: Water is called the universal solvent because more substances dissolve in water than in any other chemical . This has to do with the polarity of each water molecule. Water molecules have a polar arrangement of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms where one side (hydrogen) has a positive electrical charge, and the other side (oxygen) has a negative charge. This allows the water molecule to become attracted to many other different types of molecules. The oxygen atom in a water molecule is slightly more electronegative than a hydrogen atom. In other words, the oxygen atom is negatively charged, and the hydrogen atoms are positively charged, making the entire water molecule dipolar in nature.",

Having chronic hepatitis B, increases risk of developing liver failure, liver cancer or cirrhosis (a condition that permanently scars the liver). Option (a) is correct: HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system. It can be transmitted via the exchange of a variety of body fluids from infected people, such as blood, breast milk, semen, and vaginal secretions. The Hepatitis B virus also spreads through contact with the blood, semen, or other body fluid of a person who has HBV, much like HIV. Option (b) is not correct: Different strains of hepatitis exist, including hepatitis A, B, C, and D. Hepatitis B and hepatitis C are both viral infections that attack the liver, and they have similar symptoms. People can be effectively protected against Hepatitis B through vaccination. In fact, India is the largest producer of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine but there is no effective Hepatitis C vaccine till date. Option (c) is correct: As per the World Health Organization (WHO), Hepatitis B and C is a leading infectious killer and affects 325 million people worldwide, leading to about 1.4 million deaths a year. It is the second major killer infectious disease after tuberculosis, and nine times more people are infected with hepatitis than HIV.

Diets high in vegetables and fruits, which are good sources of antioxidants, have been found to be healthy. Examples of antioxidants include vitamins (C and E), and minerals (copper, zinc, selenium, etc.) Option (c) is correct: Antioxidants are molecules that fight free radicals in our body. Free radicals are compounds that can cause harm if their levels become too high in our body. They are linked to multiple illnesses, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Our body has its own antioxidant defences to keep free radicals in check. Antioxidants are also found in food, especially in fruits, vegetables, and other plant-based, whole foods, which may prevent some of the damage caused by free radicals by neutralising them. Antioxidant preservatives also play a crucial role in food production by increasing shelf life. Free Radicals: Free radicals are constantly being formed in your body. Without antioxidants, free radicals would cause serious harm very quickly, eventually resulting in death. However, free radicals also serve important functions that are essential for health.
